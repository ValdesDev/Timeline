# Timeline

What is this about
This is my first project as a developer. 

Timeline is a online version of a boardgame with the same name. You can check rules and get more info about it here: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128664/timeline

In this version, all the cards are from spanish history events. Cards, arts and design provide from @BlekSlayer, as he publish them on: https://labsk.net/index.php?topic=214792.0

General rules
You have to choose a card and put in in the correct place of the time line. If you fail three times putting the card, the game ends. 

Have fun!
